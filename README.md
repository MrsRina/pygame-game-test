# Terrible Bird

The game was made at school.  
I tried to make a big project to teach programming for studants of my school... But nobody cared about.
This reason I made this game with one friend, but there is nothing imporant here, just some random Python code.
There is no license, also `bird.png` image file I take from some free website sprite stuff, nothing illegal I guess.
If you want to play just execute `main.py` source code and done, every wall passed the speed boost up.
